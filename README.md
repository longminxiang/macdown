# MacDown

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uranusjr/macdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uranusjr/macdown)

MacDown is an open source Markdown editor for OS X, released under the MIT License. The author stole the idea from [Chen Luo](https://twitter.com/chenluois)’s [Mou](http://mouapp.com) so that people can [make crappy clones](https://twitter.com/remaerd/status/484914820408279040).

Visit the [project site](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for more information, or download [MacDown.app.zip](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/download/latest/) directly from the [latest releases](https://github.com/uranusjr/macdown/releases/latest) page.

## License

MacDown is released under the terms of MIT License. You may find the content of the license [here](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), or inside the `LICENSE` directory.

## Development

If you wish to build MacDown yourself, you will need the following components/tools:

* OS X 10.8 SDK
* Git
* [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

The OS X 10.8 SDK should be bundled with Xcode 5, but not with Xcode 6+. If your version of Xcode does not contain the appropriate SDK, grab a copy of Xcode 5.1.1 from [Apple’s Developer Downloads page](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) (free developer ID required), which contains the 10.8 SDK. You may also find [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11424966/1376863) on StackOverflow useful if you want to use the SDK in Xcode 6 (or later).

After cloning the repository, run the following commands inside the repository root (directory containing this `README.md` file):

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
pod install
```

and open `MacDown.xcworkspace` in Xcode. The first command initialises the dependency submodule(s) used in MacDown; the second one installs dependencies managed by CocoaPods.

Refer to the official guides of Git and CocoaPods if you need more instructions. If you run into build issues later on, try running those commands again to update the dependencies.
